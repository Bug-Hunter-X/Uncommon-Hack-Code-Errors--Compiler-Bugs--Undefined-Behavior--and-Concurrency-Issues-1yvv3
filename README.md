# Uncommon Hack Code Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon code errors that can occur in Hack, including compiler or runtime bugs, undefined behavior, and concurrency issues.  The code examples are simple, but they highlight potential problems that can be difficult to diagnose.

## Bug.hack

The `bug.hack` file contains Hack code that appears correct but may produce unexpected results due to underlying issues.

## BugSolution.hack

This file may contain a solution, workarounds, or further discussion about potential fixes depending on the specific error type encountered.  The focus here is illustrating the error scenarios rather than always providing a definitive fix, as the solutions for these uncommon errors can be complex and context-dependent.
